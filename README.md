# AnyAmountImageConverter
# made by github.com/In2Darknez

a short python script to convert image files from one to another format.

How to use:
1) create new directory
2) move your image files to that directory
3) move all contents from In2Darknez/AnyAmountImageConverter to your created directory
4) run the main.py
5) follow the instructions in the console

And after that you will have a directory called "new" which contains all the converted files and a directory "old" which contains all the old files.
